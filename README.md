# 2020-CareeFarirProgrammingChallenge
This repository contains submissions made in collaboration with Hussesin Baba Fuseini for the 2020 edition of the career fair programming challenge. The challenge questions were as follows;

Task 1

You have been provided with a log file (in CSV format) of data on the number of newly confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 by country and by date since December 2019. You have also been provided with a log file (in CSV format) of population data of countries. You are to write a programme which determines answers to the following questions:

a) Which country has the highest number of infections to date? How many infections have been recorded in that country?

b) Which country has the second highest number of infections to date? How many infections have been recorded in that country?

c) Which country has the highest infection rate (ratio of number of infections to population) to date? What is the infection rate?

d) What is the overall death rate (ratio of number of deaths to number of infections) for COVID-19?

e) Which country has the highest death rate (ratio of number of deaths to number of infections)? What is the death rate for that country?

f) In which countries is the number of new infections per day on the rise (i.e. a positive trend over the most recent 1 week of data)?

g) Of the countries above (from f), which country has the steepest increase?

h) In which countries is the number of new infections per day decreasing (i.e. a negative trend over the most recent 1 week of data)?

i) Of the countries above (from h), which country has the steepest decrease?

j) Of the countries above (from h), for which country did the number of infections per day peak the earliest? When did the number of infections per day peak, for this country?

Task 2

You have been given a third file with a list of time series data corresponding to a portion of one of the countryâ€™s new confirmed cases data. However, the data is not labelled so you do not know which country the data corresponds to, or what dates it corresponds to. Write a programme to determine which country the data corresponds to, and what the starting date of the data is.

Note that, for both tasks, your program will be tested with different data from what has been provided to you. As such, it is important that you write your program such that it adheres to the guidelines described in this document, so that your code can be run with a different input file without re-compiling your code. 

We detail our submission in the repo above. 



Please note that;
- The files must be stored in the src folder
- File name extensions have to be added when running the program, and only csv file can be used. 
- Two arguments must be passed during compilation.
